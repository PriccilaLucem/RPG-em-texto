        (A bardâ€™s lament, strummed slow by firelight)

        Long ago, wars did rend asunder,
        Prismeer and Northr, the Northern throne.
        No remorse, they crept â€˜neath nightâ€™s cold thunderâ€”
        Spilled blood like rivers, no mercy shown.

        They slaughtered all, left none alive,
        Prismeerâ€™s glory turned to flame.
        Extinguished every soul to survive,
        Erased the pulse of humankindâ€™s claim.

        Now Northrâ€™s realm, by monsters sworn,
        The sky did crack, the stars withdrew.
        Where once rose kingdoms, shadows mournâ€”
        A world undone, no dawn breaks through.

        Bardâ€™s flourish: Let this tale be sung where shadows are cast!
        Of kingdoms lost to prideâ€™s cruel blastâ€¦
        And skies that weep for futures past. ðŸŽ¶\
