    You've finally arrived with my sword...
    There's something urgent we need to discuss.

    My two shield-brothers from Prismeer discovered an ancient mine.
    Since they ventured into its depths three nights past,
    not a single word has come from them.
    The mine... it's not right. There are whispers among the townsfolk
    of unnatural sounds echoing from its tunnels after dark.

    Come with me to the bar - we'll speak more over ale.
    This isn't a conversation for open streets.

    As you push through the tavern's heavy oak door, the scent of stale ale and woodsmoke 
    washes over you. Damon leads you past rowdy mercenaries and huddled figures, their 
    conversations dying as they notice your companion's grim expression.

    The bartender stops polishing his tankards as Damon slams a fist on the counter. 
    "Two ales. The strong stuff." His voice cuts through the murmur of the crowd. 

    In the flickering torchlight, you see:
    - A pair of nervous miners whispering over a half-empty mug
    - Fresh claw marks gouged into the far wall
    - A bloodstained map pinned behind the bar
    - Damon's trembling hands as he drains his drink in one gulp

    "Now," he growls, leaning close enough for you to smell the fear-sweat on him, 
    "let me tell you what really happened to my brothers..."
