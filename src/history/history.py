    I remember when I was a child 
    and played in these quiet outskirts, 
    beyond the village. The fine dust 
    rose beneath my bare feet as I ran 
    between the crossing paths, unaware of the weight 
    that place carried. To me, the crossroads 
    was just a meeting point, where friends gathered 
    to play hide-and-seek until the sun began to fade 
    on the horizon.

    The elders used to say that at midnight,

    an entity would emerge from the shadows 
    to hear their request. But it was never free. 
    Those who accepted its favor would, sooner or later, 
    have to pay the price. I never paid much attention 
    to these stories—until the day I found, 
    buried in the dry earth, a worn-out candle 
    and an almost illegible note, where someone had written, 
    with trembling hands, a single plea: "bring him back."
